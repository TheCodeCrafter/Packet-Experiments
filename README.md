# Packet Experiments
Use this repository to expand your understanding of Spigot packets. Find new uses and innovate beyond what's been seen before.

If you haven't seen this before, the most helpful tool **ever** in the use of packets, will always be [WIKI.VG](http://wiki.vg/Protocol). This is a list of ALL packets ever used in client/server interaction in "Notchian" Minecraft. (Also: Spigot maintains all of these packets, and doesn't really change anything, so this also stands for "Spigot" and "Craftbukkit" Minecraft)

You can use the WIKI on this to learn more about packets without deciphering Java, even though we try to maintain very clear comments and well formatted code so that it is easy to understand what is hapenning.
