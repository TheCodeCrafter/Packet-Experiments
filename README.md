# Packet Experiments

Use this repository to expand your understanding of Spigot packets. Find new uses and innovate beyond what's been seen before.

If you haven't seen this before, the most helpful tool you could **ever** have in the use of packets, will always be [WIKI.VG](http://wiki.vg/Protocol). This is a list of ALL packets ever used in client/server interaction in "Notchian" Minecraft. (Also: Spigot maintains all of these packets, and doesn't really change anything, so this also stands for "Spigot" and "Craftbukkit" Minecraft)

You can use the WIKI on this to learn more about packets without deciphering Java, even though we try to maintain very clear comments and well formatted code so that it is easy to understand what is hapenning.


### Most Useful Packets

There are over 70 packets to choose from (just client-bound ones), but here are some of the most useful and helpful ones that you'll want to keep in mind for your next plugin.

#### TitlePacket

This packet is the most widely used packet, and you can use it to send titles to be displayed on player's screens. This is widely used in some well known plugins, for instance, TitleManager.
